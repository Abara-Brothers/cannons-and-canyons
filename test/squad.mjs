// Task 1's half of squads: ONE CODE NAMESPACE, and the two new frame types
// reaching the server.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A squad code and a room code are typed into the SAME
// "Enter a code" field (design D8). If the two spaces can collide, that field
// has two honest answers and no way to choose — and the failure is rare,
// silent, and seats a player in the wrong container. Nothing else in this
// tree looks at makeCode's loop condition.
//
// NOTHING UNDER TEST IS STUBBED. The room half is the REAL engine: real
// makeCode, real `rooms` Map, real create path, driven through the real
// handleClientMessage. The social half is the REAL createSocial. The only
// injected functions are the ones server.js itself injects, injected with the
// same expressions server.js uses.
//
// This suite loads public/room-engine.js, which test/social.mjs deliberately
// does not. That is the point of this one: the seam between the engine's code
// minting and the squad container is what task 1 builds.
//
// THE CODE FRAME IS NOT HERE. Its answer is computed in server.js's socket
// handler, ahead of the social layer, and nothing in process can reach that
// handler; test/code_frame.mjs drives it against a real server.js, with the
// layer off and with it on against a hanging Supabase.
//
// Headless: no server, no Chrome, no Supabase, no network, no real clock.
